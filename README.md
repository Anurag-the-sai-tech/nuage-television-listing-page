â‡’ Instructions Below are the steps to run this React Application:

 Clone the repository: git clone
 
 Navigate to the project directory: cd

 Install dependencies: npm install
 
 Run the development server by using this command in the terminal: npm start or ng serve
 
 Access the app in your browser: http://localhost:4200

 Note: The api which we are using is giving CORS error and that should be fix from backend only. So, in order to access that API we need to disable CORS in our browser. Hence I'm using 'Moesif Origin & CORS Changer' chrome extension to using our API without any issue.
